# Contributing

Thank you for considering and taking the time to contribute!ðŸ’– This is an experimental project to push newbies and help them take their first step toward open-source world. This will help them to kick-start journey as a Open-Source contributor.

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this _free_
series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub][egghead]

The following are guidelines for contributing to this project.

## Project setup

1.  Fork and clone the repo
2.  Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install dependencies
3.  Create a branch for your PR with `git checkout -b your-branch-name`

> Tip: Keep your `master` branch pointing at the original repository and make
> pull requests from branches on your fork. To do this, run:
>
> ```
> git remote add upstream https://github.com/iamdarshshah/hacktoberfest-participants.git
> git fetch upstream
> git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/master master
> ```
>
> This will add the original repository as a "remote" called "upstream," Then
> fetch the git information from that remote, then set your local `master`
> branch to use the upstream master branch whenever you run `git pull`. Then you
> can make all of your pull request branches based on this `master` branch.
> Whenever you want to update your version of `master`, do a regular `git pull`.
